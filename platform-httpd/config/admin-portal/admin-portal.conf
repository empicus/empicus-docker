    # The ProxyPass directive specifies the mapping of incoming requests to the backend server (or a cluster of servers known as a Balancer group).
    # It proxies the requests only with matching URI “/blog”
    ProxyPass / http://172.22.0.4:8080/

    #To ensure that and Location: headers generated from the backend are modified to point to the reverse proxy, instead of back to itself, #the ProxyPassReverse directive is most often required:
    ProxyPassReverse / http://172.22.0.4:8080/
